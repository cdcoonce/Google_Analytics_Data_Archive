# Google Analytics 3 Data Archive

In March of 2022 Google Analytics 3 (Universal Analytics) announced the push to transition all it's users to Google Analytics 4. July 1, 2024 was the official end date for access to all historical data in Google Analytics 3.

At the end of May 2024, I was tasked with exporting all the historical data for 70 unique properties (sites or apps) to a previously determined location on enterprice servers. This required me to develop a course of action that would allow me to obtain all fata points that the stakeholders required within a little over a month.
